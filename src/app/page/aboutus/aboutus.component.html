  <p>
    <b>The Little Journal of Northeast India</b> strives to illuminate the
    region’s quintessential qualities through people’s experiences in the
    region. Our primary focus is to share undiscovered, untold stories of the
    region. We are interested in the everyday stories of people, places and
    things based on or inspired from northeast India.

  <p>
    The journal seeks to spotlight poets, writers, photographers and artists of
    all kinds who have a story to tell. Our published poems, flash fiction,
    photographs, artwork, interviews, and essays explore and celebrate the
    under-represented, yet rich and diverse region of northeast India. We are
    looking for pieces that stick with people long after they have first read or
    witnessed it.

    The Little Journal is based on the saying
    <b>“Good things come in small packages.”</b> The journal is one of the
    smallest publishers of Northeast India and is aimed at presenting high
    quality pieces that are linguistically and aesthetically beautiful,
    ambitious and inspiring. To know more about submitting your work for our
    first issue, visit our <b>Process</b> and <b>Guidelines</b> page.
