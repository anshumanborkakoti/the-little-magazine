  <b>Submissions</b>
  Because pictures and words tell stories, The Little Journal invites submissions of visual content, (artwork, photographs
  and illustrations), poems and flash fiction, and creative nonfiction (interviews, personal essays and travel essays). We
  want pieces that don’t just tell a story, but make one feel, hear and think.
  Don’t worry if you’ve not been published before. We are more interested in what you have to say, than your publishing
  history. If you have any pieces that fit the requirements listed in our “Guidelines” page, send your submissions for our
  first issue before July 31st, 2019 to submit@the-little-journal.com.

  <b>Response Time</b>
  We are a small team and we review every submission with diligence, love and care that we believe every creative piece
  deserves. The estimated response time for a submission is four weeks. If you don’t hear from us for more than six weeks,
  please send a query.

  <b>Returning contributors</b>
  If your work has been published in the journal earlier, please wait at least three months before submitting again. If
  your submission has not been accepted, don’t take it personally. It just means that it wasn’t right for our journal at
  this time. We’d love to see your work again, but do wait at least a month before submitting new work.

  <b>Publication</b>
  By submitting to The Little Journal, you grant us first publishing rights & non-exclusive electronic permissions (for
  online archival purposes). All submissions remain foremost the intellectual property of the author/artist and rights
  revert to the author/artist upon publication. However, later, if your work is published elsewhere, please credit us
  mentioning that the piece was first published in The Little Journal.

<b>Disclaimer</b>
  The work published by The Little Journal is considered to be correct at the time of publication. The accuracy and
  authenticity of the published work here lies solely with the author/artist and the opinions/views presented here do not
  necessarily represent those of the journal.

  <b>Payment</b>
  The Little Journal was born out of sheer love and admiration for the creative arts and we don’t charge any submission or
  reading fees.

  Being a not-for-profit journal, we cannot offer payment beyond publication, support and exposure. However, you will have
  our unconditional gratitude for trusting us with your work, and if we ever meet, maybe cake. We love cake.
