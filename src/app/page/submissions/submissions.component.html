  <div class="h9">Submissions</div>
  <p>
    Because pictures and words tell stories, The Little Journal invites
    submissions of visual content, (artwork, photographs and illustrations),
    poems and flash fiction, and creative nonfiction (interviews, personal
    essays and travel essays). We want pieces that don’t just tell a story, but
    make one feel, hear and think. Don’t worry if you’ve not been published
    before. We are more interested in what you have to say, than your publishing
    history. If you have any pieces that fit the requirements listed in our
    “Guidelines” page, send your submissions for our first issue before July
    31st, 2019 to
    <a href="mailto:littlejournal.ne@gmail.com">littlejournal.ne@gmail.com</a>
  </p>
  <div class="h9">Response Time</div>
  <p>
    We are a small team and we review every submission with diligence, love and
    care that we believe every creative piece deserves. The estimated response
    time for a submission is four weeks. If you don’t hear from us for more than
    six weeks, please send a query.
  </p>

  <div class="h9">Returning contributors</div>
  <p>
    If your work has been published in the journal earlier, please wait at least
    three months before submitting again. If your submission has not been
    accepted, don’t take it personally. It just means that it wasn’t right for
    our journal at this time. We’d love to see your work again, but do wait at
    least a month before submitting new work.
  </p>

  <div class="h9">Publication</div>
  <p>
    By submitting to The Little Journal, you grant us first publishing rights &
    non-exclusive electronic permissions (for online archival purposes). All
    submissions remain foremost the intellectual property of the author/artist
    and rights revert to the author/artist upon publication. However, later, if
    your work is published elsewhere, please credit us mentioning that the piece
    was first published in The Little Journal.
  </p>

  <div class="h9">Disclaimer</div>
  <p>
    The work published by The Little Journal is considered to be correct at the
    time of publication. The accuracy and authenticity of the published work
    here lies solely with the author/artist and the opinions/views presented
    here do not necessarily represent those of the journal.
  </p>

  <div class="h9">Payment</div>
  <p>
    The Little Journal was born out of sheer love and admiration for the
    creative arts and we don’t charge any submission or reading fees. Being a
    not-for-profit journal, we cannot offer payment beyond publication, support
    and exposure. However, you will have our unconditional gratitude for
    trusting us with your work, and if we ever meet, maybe cake. We love cake.
