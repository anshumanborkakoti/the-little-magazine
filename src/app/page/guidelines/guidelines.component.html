  <h5>Guidelines</h5>
  <pre>
  <b>General Guidelines</b>
  Any piece of work that you send must be your own. Please send us only unpublished pieces. This means that your work must
  not have appeared in print or online websites (including your blog). All submissions must include a cover letter pasted
  in the body of the email and two photographs of yourself attached to the email.

  We consider pieces written in English only. To submit a writing piece, please paste it in a Word document (doc. or
  docx.) with Calibri, 11 size font. If you are submitting more than one piece of writing, please ensure that each piece
  starts off on a new page.

  <h6>Category-specific Guidelines</h6>

  <b>Poems</b>
  Send up to 5 poems pasted in a single Word document. Poems should not be longer than 45 lines each. We accept all styles
  of poetry except micro poetry.

  <b>Flash Fiction</b>
  Send up to 3 pieces of flash fiction (no more than 1000 words each).

  <b>Travel Essays</b>
  Send up to three travel essays (of 1000 or fewer words). We are seeking literary travel pieces of first-person account
  that convey a sense of people, place, time, and space. We love unique story lines and nuanced pieces that immerse us in
  its details. We are not looking for destination reviews or “how to” marketing content of any kind. To give you a sense
  of what we’d be thrilled to read is a story about a fisherman (and other interesting people you met) on a ferry ride to
  Majuli or a corner bookshop you came across in a remote town in Arunachal.

  <b>Other Personal Essays</b>
  Send up to 3 personal essays (no more than 1000 words each).

  <b>Interviews</b>
  Before submitting interviews, please start by emailing us a background on who you’d like to interview along with the
  topics you’d like to cover. We prefer in-person interviews that are no longer than 1500 words. As with other pieces, we
  like interviews that are unconventional and intellectually stimulating. Although we are an arts and literary journal, we
  are also interested in interviews of people from other spheres of human endeavour such as ecology, architecture, music,
  sociology, etc.

  <b>Visual Content</b>
  Send up to 5 pieces of art, photographs or illustrations as individual jpeg attachments (no larger than 5 MB). Please
  note that your submissions may be published as cover art of upcoming issues. For photographs, we’re seeking
  black-and-white as well as colour photos that provide a different perspective on the world around us or tell a story.

  Send all submissions to submit@the-little-journal.com and mention your submission type in the subject line along with
  your name. For example, if you are submitting three poems, write “3 Poems – Jona Dutta.”

  If you are submitting pieces across categories, mention both categories. For example: “2 Poems and 2 Photographs | Jona
  Dutta.” Please limit your submissions to two categories. We will not be publishing pieces from more than two categories
  from the same contributor.
